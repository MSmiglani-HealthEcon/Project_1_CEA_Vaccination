## Files
- Data: vaccination_inputs.csv
- Notebook: Project1_vaccination_CEA.ipynb
- Excel Model: vaccination_CEA_results.xlsx
- Report: (to be added)

## Methods
- Extracted population, vaccine cost, administration cost, treatment cost, baseline incidence, and efficacy from dataset.
- Calculated total vaccination cost, cases prevented, treatment cost averted, net cost, and cost-effectiveness ratio (CER).
- Visualized key metrics using bar plot.

## Results
- Total vaccination cost: INR 2,500,000
- Total treatment cost averted: INR 15,000,000
- Net cost: INR -12,500,000
- Cost-effectiveness ratio: INR -41,667 per case prevented
